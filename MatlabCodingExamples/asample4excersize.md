Write MATLAB code to generate and analyze different types of signals using signal processing techniques. Include the generation of a sine wave, a square wave, and a noisy signal. Plot each signal separately, and then filter the noisy signal using a low-pass Butterworth filter to reduce noise. Finally, plot both the original noisy signal and the filtered signal on the same graph for comparison.
